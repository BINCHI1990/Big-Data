It aims to introduces some methods on how to work with large datasets in R. The dataset used in this talk is not allowed to be used commercially. They must be shared on the same terms as the data was originally obtained.

Five ways to handle Big Data in R Notes: Rule of thumb: Data sets that contain up to one million records can easily processed with standard R. Data sets with about one million to one billion records can also be processed in R, but need some additional effort. Data sets that contain more than one billion records need to be analyzed by map reduce algorithms.
