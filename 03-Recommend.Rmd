## Resources for handling big data in R
  
 -   [Handling large data sets in R](https://rpubs.com/msundar/large_data_analysis)
<br><br>

> **Notes:**
>
> Medium sized datasets (< 2 GB):loaded in R ( within memory limit but processing is cumbersome (typically in the 1-2 GB range )
>
> Large files that cannot be loaded in R due to R / OS limitations 
>
> - Large files(2 - 10 GB):process locally using some work around solutions
>
> - Very Large files( > 10 GB):needs distributed large scale computing.

<br><br>

> **Notes:**
>
> Rule of thumb:
>
> Data sets that contain up to one million records can easily processed with standard R.
>
> Data sets with about one million to one billion records can also be processed in R, but need some additional effort.
>
> Data sets that contain more than one billion records need to be analyzed by map reduce algorithms.
